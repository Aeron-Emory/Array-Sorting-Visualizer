# Array Sorting Visualizer

Originally from: https://github.com/dipesh-m/Sorting-Visualizer
(didn't fork cause wanted it to be as a solution)

Works same as before, same controls. 
The changes made are updating code from SDL2 to SDL3.
For now exe will not be provided as the previous repository already has an exe using SDL2 in releases and it works.
this repository is for updated SDL3 code only

To use this repository, clone it, have Visual Studio installed, open the solution file (.sln), click run, and should work, granted that you have added the SDL3 lib in the linker.
get the lib from: [SDL3-devel-3.2.8-VC.zip](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/download/release-3.2.8/SDL3-devel-3.2.8-VC.zip)

extract it
find the directory
SDL3-3.2.8\lib\(x64/x86/arm64)
copy the directory based on your machine
paste it in the SDL3 folder inside Sort Array Folder
